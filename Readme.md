## ðŸš€ About Me
Hi, My Name is Gangesh Gunjan Jha and I have 6+ years of experience in Automation Testing using technologies like Selenium Webdriver, RestAssured.

My major expertise is in Java Programming Language.


## Prerequisites
Before running this framework, ensure the following software is installed on your system:

- **Java 11** - Make sure Java is installed and the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set.
- **Maven** - Ensure Maven is installed and added to the system path.
- **Download Link**: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi


## Features

- **Data-Driven Testing**: Using OpenCSV, Apache POI, and Gson for reading test data from CSV and Excel files and JSON.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Supports running tests on different browsers.
- **Headless Mode**: Faster execution by running tests in headless mode.
- **Cloud Testing**: Integrated with LambdaTest to run tests on the cloud.
- **Logging**: Uses Log4j for detailed logs.
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed reports using Extent Reports.

## Technologies Used
- Java 11
- TestNG
- OpenCSV
- Gson
- Apache POI
- Faker
- LambdaTest
- Log4j
- Extent Reports

## Setup Instructions
**Clone the Repository**:
---
    git clone https://github.com/ujha777/Test-Automation-Framework
    cd Test-Automation-Framework 

**Running Tests on LambdaTest**:
---
    mvn test  -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=true -DisHeadless=false -X

**Running Tests on Chrome browser on Local Machine in Headless Mode**:
---  
    mvn test  -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=false -DisHeadless=true -X

## Reports & Logs
-Reports: After execution, a detailed HTML report will be generated at ./report.html.

The report contains information on test cases executed, passed, failed, and skipped, along with screenshots for failed tests.

## Logs:
Logs are created during the test execution and stored in the ./logs/ directory.

## Integrated the project Github Actions
This automation framework is integrated with github actions. The tests will be executed at 11:30PM IST every single day.

The reports will be archieved in gh-pages branch You can view the html reports at :
